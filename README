NAME
    googlesearch - command line interface to google search

DESCRIPTION
    I wanted to simply ask for top x results for something, and see a list
    of result urls.

USAGE
    googlesearch [OPTION].. TERMS..

       -m number      max results, default is 10.
       -t             trim results display to fully qualified domain name
       -o             override cache (set at 6 hours)

  EXAMPLE USAGE
    First 20 results for 'boston ice cream'

       googlesearch  -m 20 boston ice cream

CONFIG
    You will need a ~/.googlesearch/config.yml file with: ___
    LOCAL_GOOGLE_KEY: yourkey LOCAL_GOOGLE_KEY_REFERER:
    siteassociatedwithabovekey

    This is a YAML file.

    What is the google key and key referer? You will need to have a google
    account and google api key to use this cli. This is the LOCAL_GOOGLE_KEY
    noted in the config file. The referer is what website you generated that
    key for.

    Generating a google search api key allows you to put a search in your
    website. It also allows you to use this interface to search in general.
    (I know- it seems like- why don't we just scrape http results, right?
    No. Grow up, rookie. They provide the api, use it.)

CAVEATS
    In development. If you notice bugs, or wish for extension, please
    contact the AUTHOR.
